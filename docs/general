features analysis :

todo features : 
* all links new line seperated (adv : direct pasting by Alt+V in chrome, preserves all data, searchable, disad : clumsy to handle, big and multiple line), 
* all links space seperated (comes in one line, all datapreserved and searchable but still its not one clickable link or easily sharable),
* all links query params or some kind of concatenation (so that behave as one link with all info preserved and searchable, still big and clumsy), 
* one link base64 encoded (one link, non clumsy, preserves data, disad : non searchable immediately, partial reliance on ext or server to get the links, still he can do base64 decoding and findout), 
* one shortened link (non clumsy, easy to handle, no data preservation in the link itself , non searchable. completely dependant on the extn or server to make it work)


todo features : 
* how to tab select links instead of window.
 * how to manual pasting links and create a link2links. 
 * Check for any standard on this link to links thing


the current mthod will fail once the url reaches 1024 char. it will reach once there are say 10 links.

feature : persiste links in groups to view. like bookmarks.

feature : when there are more number of links opening all is a bad idea. instead can be shown in a page given option to open any one or all of them or select and open.

the above sounds like the a global bookmarks. Its like sharing amazon shoppinglist (not sure if anyone using that). Its global bookmarks
